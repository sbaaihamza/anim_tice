Manim lesson scripts (exported from the current chat context)

Included:
- M3_L26_represent_parts_on_bar_models.py
- M3_N09_multiplication_tables_6_7.py
- M3_G07_standard_shapes_properties.py

Note:
In this workspace I only have direct access to the scripts that are visible in the current conversation context.
If you want me to also include earlier lesson scripts (from previous messages/conversations), paste them here (or upload as .py),
and I’ll append them and regenerate the zip.
